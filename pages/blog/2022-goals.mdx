# Goals for 2022

## Having a better CLI

Currently, the CLI is a bit wonky. It can break at any moment for any reason. If
you try to compile a scene with a syntax error, it will crash without explaining
why it failed. The way it compiles scenes isn't great: instead of getting all
the needed data once, the CLI executes multiple times the Dart file. It may be
interesting to use the [Embedding
Dart](https://dart.dev/server/c-interop-native-extensions) API. Also, there are
way too many options (`--gl`, `--webdev`, `--html`, ...). It's difficult to know
which flag is important.

## Support other rendering back-ends

Currently, the only supported rendering API is the HTML 2D Canvas. However,
using Cairo to render non-interactive animations would be faster than the 2D
Canvas API: the scene code could be compiled to a native executable which would
run a lot quicker compared to a JavaScript file. I started implementing the
Cairo backend, but it's not finished yet: gradients aren't implemented.

3D rendering could be done with OpenGL/WebGL. However, these libraries are made
to render triangles or polygons not shapes defined with BÃ©zier curves. So, it
could take a while to implement. 

## Precompiled videos

_(suggested by JCosmos)_

When rendering complex animations, it would be better to render this animation
in the compilation step. Otherwise, it may lag someone's computer when running
this animation. It could be done right now but it's better to wait for the Cairo
backend integration and the CLI improvement.

I hope it can be done quite easily with something similar to this:
```dart highlight=12
class TestScene extends Scene {
	@override
	Future construct() async {
		await part1();
		await part2();
	}

	Future part1() async {
		// animations here
	}

	@precompiled
	Future part2() async {
		// animations here
	}
}
```

## More documentation

One advantage of Dart is `dartdoc`. It's a tool that'll generate documentation
based on comments in the code. For example, a well-documented class is the
`AbstractDisplay` ([API Reference
page](https://pub.dev/documentation/manim_web/latest/display/AbstractDisplay-class.html))

## AsciiMath integration
AsciiMath is an alternative syntax for <LaTeX/>. For example, when you want to
draw this formula: <BaselFormula />
You can use this <LaTeX/> code:`\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} =
\frac{\pi^2}{6}`.
However, the backslash character is reserved for strings and needs to be escaped
with another backslash: `\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2} =
\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}`

But, in AsciiMath, it's : `sum_(n=1)^oo 1/n^2 = pi^2/6`. Also, most <LaTeX/>
code is valid AsciiMath code.

## GUI for ManimWeb

It's very unlikely this goal will be achieved this year. However, it may be
interesting to have suggestions on the way it would work.

## Community goals

This year, it would be awesome to have projects that use ManimWeb. If someone
wants to make a project with ManimWeb and has some problems, I'd gladly help.

Also, it could be nice to have a simpler logo for the Discord server and the
website.
